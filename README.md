# ComplexityandNetworks
This is the work I undertook during my Complexity and Networks course at Imperial College.


The course was split into two parts: Complexity and Networks. This repository reflect this structure - you
can find information regarding each half inside the respective folders.

This is a short piece about the Complexity and Networks course:

Stephen Hawking has predicted that the 21st Century will be “the century of complexity”. A major theme
in Complexity Science is seeing how interactions between many small but interacting parts can lead the the
emergence of dramatic results on large scales. This could be the way that the we see rare, yet occasionally
observed large fluctuations in complex systems: stock market crashes, earthquakes, extreme weather are all
good examples. Simple gaussian statistics can not describe these problems.
If we are to understand these emergent features, we must understand the way the parts of a system interact.
This is where networks play an important role. Physicists provided major new insights in the late 1990’s showing
how to describe the links between parts of a complex system when they were connected neither randomly (gas
molecules) nor regularly (as in a regular lattice of atoms).
However Complexity and Networks are areas which are truly cross-disciplinary involving mathematicians,
physicists, computer scientists, engineers, biologists, and even the humanities. Over the last two decades the
ideas of Complexity and Networks have become of central importance, and have already made a profound
impact on our modern world. For instance the core idea behind Google’s search algorithm relies on insights on
how web pages are connected. Controlling the spread of the next flu epidemic will be based on models rooted
in concepts from Complexity and Networks. The emergence of Complexity Science reflects the rapid growth in
computational power and the role of information in the modern era.
This course dips physicists’ toes into the basic ideas and tools for describing and analysing complex phenomena.
